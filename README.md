# Markstrat-Business-Simulation-Team-Turquois
This repository documents my work in the Markstrat B2B business simulation, completed as part of my undergraduate B2B Marketing course. The simulation replicated real-world competitive markets where 30+ students managed virtual companies across multiple industries.

Key Contributions & Outcomes:
* Designed and executed end-to-end marketing strategy: market research, segmentation, pricing, promotion, and distribution.
* Directed R&D investments and product launches to maximize long-term growth.
* Optimized cost structures while maintaining high product appeal (4/5 consumers preferred our offerings).

Our team achieved:
* Highest revenue ever in course history ($1.97B+)
* 43.8% market share â€“ market leader by a wide margin
* Record units sold in a single period

By combining B2B theory with hands-on decision-making, this project provided practical insights into business strategy, competitive intelligence, and market leadership.
